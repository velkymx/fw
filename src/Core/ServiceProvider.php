/**
 * Base class for service providers.
 *
 * Service providers are the central place to configure and bootstrap
 * framework and application services. Each provider has two lifecycle
 * methods:
 *
 * - register(): Called during application bootstrap. Register bindings
 *   and services in the container. Do not resolve dependencies here.
 *
 * - boot(): Called after all providers are registered. Safe to resolve
 *   dependencies and perform initialization that depends on other services.
 *
 * Example:
 *     class CacheServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
 *     {
 *         public function register(): void
 *         {
 *             $this->container->singleton(CacheInterface::class, fn() => new RedisCache(
 *                 $this->app->config('cache.redis.host')
 *             ));
 *         }
 *
 *         public function boot(): void
 *         {
 *             // Safe to resolve services here
 *             $cache = $this->container->get(CacheInterface::class);
 *             $cache->connect();
 *         }
 *     }
